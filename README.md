# Overview: Talina
A Discord bot written in Python, able to use Slash commands.

Main functions include:
- /f1 (Shows next F1 event times)
- /fn (Poor man's Nitro)
- And some minor ones, you can view them in the code.

As the functions are Slash commands, the usage should be self-explanatory.

# Installation
1) Install the required packages in `requirements.txt`
2) Generate a bot token
3) Create a .env file in the same directory as main.py and enter the token in the file like so:`TOKEN=[your token here]`
   - Or, if you can't get that working, just place the token in main.py at the bottom, replacing `os.environ['TOKEN']`.
5) Run main.py
6) Commit die
